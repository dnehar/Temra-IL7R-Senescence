Sestrins induce natural killer function in senescent-like CD8+ T cells

We used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to investigate the transcriptomes of ~62,000 CD8+ T cells isolated from six healthy older donors (72–88 y). 
CD8+IL-7R+ and CD8+IL-7R− T cells were sorted from each donor resulting in 12 samples.
